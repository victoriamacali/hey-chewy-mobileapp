The main components of our app include: 
creating pet profile(s) 
1. Local Upload of PDFs or Scanned Documents 
2. Keeping Track of Pet(s) medical records
3. Storing Major Reminders (ex. 6 month check up)
4. Daily To-Do List

We were able to create this purr-fect app with the React Native Framework, 
with plans to connect it to  a MySQL  database.
